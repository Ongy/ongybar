This is the documentation of the binary used to read in data from complying
sources.

TODO: Evaluate this!
Note: Because of the implicit size of elements, this is not forward compatible.
It may be interesting to add a size argument to element.

The bar expects an (infinite) sequence of Lists on the pipe. The lists have the
number of elements encoded, so there's no special delimiter between the lists.

All elements have a size defined by their type. The type of an element is
usually known ahead of time.

Multibyte values encoded in host byteorder. If this is sent over the network in
some way, the network adapter has to understand it and translate it properly!

In this document, The format is:
